The end-user will run this script to test network connectivity. The intent is to make troubleshooting easier by having the end-user run the script and communicate to the system administrator if each test was successful or not. From the CentOS 8 virtual machine, the script will test connectivity to the gateway, a remote IP address, and a URL to validate that DNS resolution is working. Because the end-user is running the script, the output must be direct and unambiguous. You want to be confident that the end-user is giving you accurate information.
